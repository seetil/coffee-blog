        <h2>"Living my best coffee life"</h2>
        <p>
          Living in Glasgows west end means great coffee can be found on every
          other block. Glasgow has no shortage of coffee shops!! But in a bid to
          save some money I have signed up for a monthly subscription to Pact
          coffee. Pact is a coffee bean company that sends you a different, high
          quality bag of coffee beans (whole or ground) as often as you choose
          and at a very decent price. This blog will document the different
          beans I recieve while living my best coffee life.

        <h2>"You never forget your first..."</h2>
        <p>
          21/11/20 My first pact delivery has arrived! I recieved a bag of beans
          called <strong>Planalto</strong>. It originates from Minas Gerais,
          Brazil and was grown by Sergio and Mariza Mantovaninni. The package
          states tasting notes of 'malt milk chocolate shake' and mouthfeel is
          'round'. Giving the beans a quick blend in the grinder causes a
          disgruntled, sleepy flatmate to emerge from her room and a delicious
          smell of fresh coffee wafting across our little kitchen. After 5
          minutes stewing in the french press I poured my first pact coffee. The
          heavy flavour comes through from the first sip. It tastes almost sweet
          and has a fantastic fullness to it. Very happy with my first coffee
          bean delivery. 9/10 would recommend.
