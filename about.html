      <h2>A blog: written, coded and imagined by Seetil</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! My name is Seetil. I am a restaurant manager/ web developer in
        training/ tobacco and caffeine addled Partick resident! Writing and
        coding this blog as the latest in a long string of lockdown hobbies and
        projects. Anything to keep the furlough delirium at bay.

        Few notes about my coffee habits: I order my coffee as whole beans as I
        prefer to grind them myself. The smell of freshly ground coffee is one
        of lifes purist pleasures and quite possibly what has driven me to this
        aparent coffee bean snobbery! I use a french press as opposed to filter
        coffee - yes there is a difference! The grinds are less fine for a
        french press and I feel that the coffee infuses much better in a french
        press giving a fuller taste to the resulting coffee.
